# Democritus

## Experiments: STAGE 1
This is the first prototype I have created for the project. The main backend algorithm. 
its CQM -> BQM
Some experiemtns should be repeated with a QPU
Prototype: [Prototype}()

### Experiments Summary    
| No | Title             | Short Description | Expected Result | Pass | Repeat with QPU |
|:---|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|  |
| #1 | Variable Count    | | Correct No | ✅ | |
| #2 | Coefficient Range | | penalties ~10–100× objective |  | ✅ |  |
| #3 | all-zero energy   | |  high (infeasible) |  |  |  |
| #4 | one-hot energy    | | lowest when constraint satisfied |  |  |  |
| #5 | sampler run       | | returns diverse samples |  |  |  | 
| #6 | feasibility check | | all violations = 0 |  |  |  |
| #7 | route cost check  | | matches true cost |  |  |  |
| #8 | visualization     | | continuous, valid routes |  |  |  |
